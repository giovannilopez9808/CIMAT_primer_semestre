\section*{Problema 1}
\textbf{A lighthouse L is located on a small island 5 km north of a point A on a straight east-west shoreline. A cable is to be laid from L to point B on the shoreline 10 km east of A. The cable will be laid through the water in a straight line from L to a point C on the shoreline between A and B, and from there to B along the shoreline. (see Figure \ref{fig:problema1}). The part of the cable lying in the water costs \$5.000/km, and the part along the shoreline costs \$3, 000/km. Where should C be chosen to minimize the total cost of the cable?}
